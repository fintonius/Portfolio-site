# Portfolio-site

I got bogged down with my initial portfolio site for the FAC application getting too caught up with 
designing the layout and losing sight of the functional, code focused things I wanted to do with the 
site. 

I ended up not having much of a plan for adding the features in and when attempting to do so they 
clashed or interacted unexpectedly with the existing content as the structure wasn't optimised for 
incorporating the features.

As such I am restarting the site with a simpler design and a clearer plan on what features to add
and how to add them. 

The rest of my intentions and goals remain the same from the first site so have just copied them in 
below!

 
**What do I want to achieve with this site?**
- Have a "clean" professional looking site that uses motion and visuals to add interest for the user.
- Become more proficient with using Git and commits as part of the building process.
- Use scroll events to trigger animations and other effects on the site.
- Gain experience working with SVGs for graphical elements and animations.
- Learn more about animations in CSS, especially @keyframes 
- Improve code structure and comment use for easier to read & understand code.
- Gain experience working with AI as a "collaborative" tool to aid with design ideas, icons and structure.

**What content does the site contain?**
- Personal statement
- Links to previous projects
- Links to Github & Codewars accounts
- Link back to the GitHub repo
- CV, education & experience

**Include at least 5 Things from below on the site:**
- An animated underline effect when hovering over link text.
- An effect/animation that is triggered by the user scrolling the site:
    - Text fading in||out
    - Background colours changing by section
    - Images/icons/text moving onto//out of screen
- A dark theme toggle
- An animation effect on the project link icons:
    - They move on hover
    - They flip on mouse down
    - Each icon changes into an info card when clicked. It contains a brief
      description of the project and a link to it
- The different icons in the project section has an effect on it:
    - They move onto the screen when scrolling into section
    - Use the scroll wheel to cycle through the options
- Some sort of "scroll driven" animation on the page:
    - The 360 turn rotoscope animation turns left or right depending on up/down scroll
    - A rotoscope of Muybridge's horse runs across the screen moving L -> R || R -> L
      depending on up/down scroll
- A functioning 'Contact me' form
- Customise the tab image!

**FAC Guidelines and Advice:**

- Be a single-page website;
- Use vanilla HTML/CSS without frameworks;
- Use GitHub pages;
- Link back to the GitHub repo for the website and make sure that your [Git commits tell a story](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/).

**Some advice:**

- Start with a Personal statement
    - Keep it short. Briefly tell the story of what drew you to software development as a career path.
    - If you have a previous career, articulate why you are making this career switch and what in your employment history is relevant to your future career.
    - Focus on your motivation for becoming a software developer and what sets you apart as a candidate, not what you want from your future employer.
    - Avoid bland statements about *"working well in teams"* or *"thriving under pressure"* and such like, which say nothing interesting or relevant about you.
    - Focus on the tasks you do well, have demonstrated through your work or interests that you can do, and which will be useful to you as a developer.
- Include relevant experience
    
    If you have already done some freelance developer work (paid or not), lead with it. Even if it is not your best work, any work you have done with any sort of client is a differentiator.
    
- Side projects and self-learning
    - Put any side projects and relevant courses you have completed in your portfolio.
    - Link to any profiles you have on sites like Code Wars.
- Previous career
    
    If you are looking for your first role as a developer, this may be the most interesting thing about you. Relate your previous work to the skills that you might need to be a good developer. 
    
- Education and training
    
    If you have a degree or degrees, name them.
    If you left university without graduating or you never went to university, don’t be afraid to mention it, especially if you can demonstrate other forms of learning, such as online courses, that you have completed.
    

If you feel it’s appropriate, you are welcome to use elements from your FAC application website too.
